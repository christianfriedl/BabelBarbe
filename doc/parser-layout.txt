FETCH/UNFETCH only happens at exactly one place, in sentence
    -> NOPE, repetitions!


sentence
    if alternatives==null 
        --> we are a terminal, fetch-and-return/unfetch
    else
        --> fetch first word 
        --> get all first terminals from alternatives
        --> compare against each
        --> if there are none, return null
        --> (if there are more than one, stop with an exception)
        --> return the parse of the one that matches

alternative
    if phrases==null
        --> ??? exception ???
    else
        return (phrase1 AND phrase2 ...)

phrase
    one-repetition:
        if (sentence1 AND sentence2 ...) return ast
        else rollback and return null
    one-or-more-repetitions:
        if (sentence1 AND sentence2 ...) we are parsed; 
        repeat (sentence1 AND sentence2 ...) and add to ast;

        if we are parsed, return ast
        else rollback and return null
    zero-or-more-repetitions:
        we are parsed
        repeat (sentence1 AND sentence2 ...) and add to ast;
        return ast
